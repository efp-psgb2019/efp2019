  **ATTENTION:** The format should follow Folia Primatologica guidelines. Please find examples in the following link: http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/435825<br><br>
  More especially, please pay attention to the following points:<br><br>
  •	Each word in the title starts with an upper case letter and is in bold.<br>
  •	Names of authors are in italics.<br>
  •	Indicate address for each author.<br>
  •	Indicate the email of the main author - just one email is needed.<br>
  •	No keywords are needed.<br>
  •	No figures, tables or references are allowed.<br>
  •	All numbers should be numerals not written, except at the start of a sentence.<br>
  •	UK English should be used throughout.<br>
  <br><br>
  Studies should complied with the European Directive 2010/63/EU and/or the 
  International Primatological Society (IPS) Guidelines for the Use of Nonhuman 
  Primates in Research and, when applicable, specify the name/number of the 
  protocols approved by institutional/governmental committees. However, the 
  abstracts in Folia Primatologica don’t need to say they follow ethical guidelines.<br><br>
  All abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee that has the right 
  to either refuse an abstract that do not meet professional standards or to 
  designate it as oral or poster, and to choose a suitable session for its presentation. 
  When possible the Scientific Committee will try to comply with authors requests. <br><br>
  The Scientific Committee will not normally enter into correspondence with 
  submitting authors concerning rejected abstracts or proposals.
  <br><br>
