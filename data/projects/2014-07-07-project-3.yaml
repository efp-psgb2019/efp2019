#  <br>There is just one ticket price for this conference; registration costs £125 and 
#  includes a banquet at St Hugh’s College on Tuesday 10th September for the first 160 
#  people to register. Above this limit, further registrations are welcome, but 
#  attendees will not receive the banquet as part of their conference package. <br><br> 
#  <h4>Abstract Submission</h4>
#  If you are interested in showcasing your research at the conference, through a 
#  presentation, poster, symposium, or workshop, please use the abstract submission 
#  forms which can be downloaded from the home page of this website. Registration for 
#  the conference is required before you can submit an abstract.
#  <br>

#  <br><br>
#  More especially, please pay attention to the following points:<br><br>
#  •	Each word in the title starts with an upper case letter and is in bold.<br>
#  •	Names of authors are in italics.<br>

#  Primates in Research and, when applicable, specify the name/number of the 
#  protocols approved by institutional/governmental committees. However, the 
#  abstracts in Folia Primatologica don’t need to say they follow ethical guidelines.<br><br>
#  All abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee that has the right

#  submitting authors concerning rejected abstracts or proposals.
#  <br><br>
#  
#  <h4>Information for Presenters</h4>
#  <br>
#  <h5>Podium and Symposium Presentations</h5>
#  <br>
#  Each presenter will be given a 15-minute slot, including 12 minutes of presentation and 3 
#  minutes for questions. The chair of the session will give a 2-minute warning at the 10-minute mark. 
#  Presentations must be in .ppt or .pptx, in the Standard (4:3) format. Please bring you presentation on 
#  a USB drive to be uploaded to the system the day before the presentation (for all morning sessions) or

#  target="_blank">Oxford Print Centre </a> (for the city centre/Maths Institute). If you choose to use these 
#  services, we recommend that you contact them in advance to ensure that your poster is printed and ready to 
#  be picked up on time for your presentation.
#  <br><br>
#  
#  
#  <h4>Bursaries</h4>
#  **All bursaries have now been awarded.**<br><br> 
#  Students, if you would like to present your work at the conference but are unable to 
#  cover the costs of registration and accommodation, there are a limited number of 
#  bursaries available. <br><br> 
#  <h4>Conference facilities</h4>
#  The two full days of the conference will take place in the Mathematical Institute. 
#  Tea, coffee, and snacks will be provided, but see 
#  <a href="https://goo.gl/GqesMw" target="_blank">the maps</a>

#  <h4>Childcare options</h4>
#  The organising committee is conducting a brief survey to gauge interest in 
#  childcare being provided at the conference. Please take a moment to complete
#  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1shTanYhHZwm-Cq5PX1pxS6xW89KgsqfIsI56_BGLwRU/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank">our survey.</a>
#  <br><br>
#  In addition to conference-provided childcare, the buildings where the conference 
#  will take place host a variety of facilities to make life easier for conference 
#  attendees with young children. The Maths Institute contains nappy changing stations 
#  and access to a quiet room upon request. The MI also contains keycard accessible 
#  lifts which can accommodate prams. St Hugh’s College and Oxford Brookes are similarly accommodating.
#  <br><br>
#  Finally, Oxford Sitters, a child-minding service endorsed by the University of Oxford, 
#  is able to provide individual childcare for parents at a charge of £15 per booking, 
#  and an additional £10 per hour paid directly to the sitter. For more information, 
#  please visit <a href="https://oxfordsitters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Sitters</a>. 
#  If you have any further questions regarding  childcare, please contact us at 
#  info@efp-psgb2019.com or using the site's contact form. 
#  <br><br>
#  <h4>Accessibility</h4>
#  Both the Maths Institute and Oxford Brookes are wheelchair accessible. 
#  Entrance to the banquet at St Hugh’s College is also accessible, although not 
#  all accommodation is, so please request a wheelchair accessible room when you 
#  book. All three buildings contain wheelchair accessible and gender neutral 
#  toilets. The Maths Institute has a lift that is accessible through keycards; 
#  please let us know if you will need to use the lift, and a keycard will be 
#  provided to you. The Maths Institute also has hearing aid loops installed in 
#  all lecture theatres, and a quiet room accessible upon request.<br>
#  <br>
#  We adhere to the PSGB policy on inclusion. You can read more about it

#  <br><br>
#  
#  <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
#  At EFP-PSGB 2019, we believe that an attending body representing diverse 
#  backgrounds, people and topics promotes an environment of learning and knowledge 
#  exchange. The EFP-PSGB 2019 conference operates as a platform for an open and respectful
#  exchange and discussion of research and ideas within a respectful and tolerant community.
#  We expect all participants to treat each other with respect and dignity, and without 
#  discrimination or harassment of any kind.
#  <br><br>
#  You can learn more about our Code of Conduct [here] (/EFP-PSGB2019_CofConduct.pdf).
#  <br><br>
#  
#  
#  <h4>F.A.Q.</h4>
#  **Are there different rates for students/members?**<br>

#  includes the banquet for the first 160 people that register.<br>
#  <br>
#  **When is the deadline for registration?**<br>
#  Registration will close when we reach capacity, so be sure to book ASAP to be

#  <br>
#  **How do I travel from Oxford Brookes University to the Oxford Mathematics Department?**<br>
#  The events at Oxford Brookes University and the Mathematics Department will be on different days,

  <h4>Transport</h4>
  <h5>To Oxford</h5>
  **From London:** Oxford can be easily reached by trains running from London Paddington and London Marylebone. The Oxford Rail Station has easy access by foot to the city centre. Oxford can also be reached by bus via the OxfordTube or the X90 which leave from convenient central London locations including Victoria Station, Marble Arch, and Marylebone Road and finish their route at Gloucester Green Station in Oxford city centre.
  <br>
  **From Airports:** The Airline (run by the Oxford Bus Company) runs day and night connecting Oxford with Heathrow and Gatwick airports by bus.

  Most locations in Oxford city centre (including St Hugh’s College and the Mathematical Institute)  are easily reachable by foot. Rentable cycles are also often parked throughout and can be paid for via mobile. <a href="https://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables-tickets/Oxford">The Oxford Bus Company</a> runs buses throughout Oxford day and night, providing a convenient connection between Oxford Brookes University and the city centre.

  <h4>Other goings on</h4>
  <h5>St Giles' Fair</h5>
  St Giles’ Fair will be taking place on the 9th and 10th of September near the Maths Institute. It may limit vehicular access to the conference and cyclists will also be asked to dismount to walk down St Giles’ Street. For more information about road closures and diverted public transport over the two days, please see <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20013/about_oxford/557/st_giles_fair/2">this page</a>.
