  <h4>Registration</h4>
  You can register

  to secure your place for the EFP-PSGB Conference 2019. 
  <br>There is just one ticket price for this conference; registration costs £125 and 
  includes a banquet at St Hugh’s College on Tuesday 10th September for the first 160 
  people to register. Above this limit, further registrations are welcome, but 
  attendees will not receive the banquet as part of their conference package. <br><br> 
  <h4>Abstract Submission</h4>
  If you are interested in showcasing your research at the conference, through a 
  presentation, poster, symposium, or workshop, please use the abstract submission 
  forms which can be downloaded from the home page of this website. Registration for 
  the conference is required before you can submit an abstract.
  <br>
  Abstract Guidelines and Submission<br><br>
  Deadline for abstract submission: 10th May<br><br>
  Abstracts of individual presentations either for Symposium, Podium or Poster Sessions should include:<br>
  • Title. With each word capitalized.<br>
  • Author(s) - first name, last name.<br>

  of which author belongs to which institution (using the superscripts a, b, c, ...).<br>
  • E-Mail of the first Author.<br>
  • The abstract should not exceed 2000 characters including spaces (approx. 350 words).
  <br><br>
  **ATTENTION:** The format should follow Folia Primatologica guidelines. 
  Please find examples in the following link: 
  <a href="http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/435825" target="_blank">Karger guidelines</a>
  <br><br>
  More especially, please pay attention to the following points:<br><br>
  •	Each word in the title starts with an upper case letter and is in bold.<br>
  •	Names of authors are in italics.<br>
  •	Indicate address for each author.<br>
  •	Indicate the email of the main author - just one email is needed.<br>
  •	No figures, tables or references are allowed.<br>
  •	All numbers should be numerals not written, except at the start of a sentence.<br>
  •	UK English should be used throughout.<br>
  <br><br>
  Studies should complied with the European Directive 2010/63/EU and/or the 
  International Primatological Society (IPS) Guidelines for the Use of Nonhuman 
  Primates in Research and, when applicable, specify the name/number of the 
  protocols approved by institutional/governmental committees. However, the 
  abstracts in Folia Primatologica don’t need to say they follow ethical guidelines.<br><br>
  All abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee that has the right 
  to either refuse an abstract that do not meet professional standards or to 
  designate it as oral or poster, and to choose a suitable session for its presentation. 
  When possible the Scientific Committee will try to comply with authors requests. <br><br>
  The Scientific Committee will not normally enter into correspondence with 
  submitting authors concerning rejected abstracts or proposals.
  <br><br>
  
  <h4>Information for Presenters<h4>
  <br><br>

  them by the end of the day on **Tuesday, Sep. 10**.<br>
  There are two nearby poster printing locations in Oxford: <a href="https://www.brookes.ac.uk/brookes-print/"
  target="_blank">Brookes Print</a> (for Oxford Brookes), and <a href="https://www.oxford-print-centre.co.uk/"
  target="_blank">Oxford Print Centre </a> (for the city centre/Maths Institute). If you choose to use these 
  services, we recommend that you contact them in advance to ensure that your poster is printed and ready to 
  be picked up on time for your presentation.
  <br><br>
  
  
  <h4>Bursaries</h4>
  **ANNOUNCEMENT: we have decided to extend the student bursary deadline to APRIL 15th, 5pm GMT.**<br><br> 
  Students, if you would like to present your work at the conference but are unable to 
  cover the costs of registration and accommodation, there are a limited number of 
  bursaries available. <br><br> 
  <h4>Conference facilities</h4>
  The two full days of the conference will take place in the Mathematical Institute. 
  Tea, coffee, and snacks will be provided, but see 
  <a href="https://goo.gl/GqesMw" target="_blank">the maps</a>
  for restaurants and lunch spots around the venue.

  <h4>Childcare options</h4>
  The organising committee is conducting a brief survey to gauge interest in 
  childcare being provided at the conference. Please take a moment to complete
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1shTanYhHZwm-Cq5PX1pxS6xW89KgsqfIsI56_BGLwRU/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank">our survey.</a>
  <br><br>
  In addition to conference-provided childcare, the buildings where the conference 
  will take place host a variety of facilities to make life easier for conference 
  attendees with young children. The Maths Institute contains nappy changing stations 
  and access to a quiet room upon request. The MI also contains keycard accessible 
  lifts which can accommodate prams. St Hugh’s College and Oxford Brookes are similarly accommodating.
  <br><br>
  Finally, Oxford Sitters, a child-minding service endorsed by the University of Oxford, 
  is able to provide individual childcare for parents at a charge of £15 per booking, 
  and an additional £10 per hour paid directly to the sitter. For more information, 
  please visit <a href="https://oxfordsitters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Sitters</a>. 
  If you have any further questions regarding  childcare, please contact us at 
  info@efp-psgb2019.com or using the site's contact form. 
  <br><br>
  <h4>Accessibility</h4>
  Both the Maths Institute and Oxford Brookes are wheelchair accessible. 
  Entrance to the banquet at St Hugh’s College is also accessible, although not 
  all accommodation is, so please request a wheelchair accessible room when you 
  book. All three buildings contain wheelchair accessible and gender neutral 
  toilets. The Maths Institute has a lift that is accessible through keycards; 
  please let us know if you will need to use the lift, and a keycard will be 
  provided to you. The Maths Institute also has hearing aid loops installed in 
  all lecture theatres, and a quiet room accessible upon request.<br>

  <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
  At EFP-PSGB 2019, we believe that an attending body representing diverse 
  backgrounds, people and topics promotes an environment of learning and knowledge 
  exchange. The EFP-PSGB 2019 conference operates as a platform for an open and respectful
  exchange and discussion of research and ideas within a respectful and tolerant community.
  We expect all participants to treat each other with respect and dignity, and without 
  discrimination or harassment of any kind.

  <br>
  **How do I travel from Oxford Brookes University to the Oxford Mathematics Department?**<br>
  The events at Oxford Brookes University and the Mathematics Department will be on different days,
  so there should be no need to travel between these places on the same day.
  However, depending on where you are staying you may need to use the bus services
  that run in Oxford. 
  <a href="https://city.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables-fares/" target="_blank">OxfordBus</a> 
  has timetables of buses throughout Oxford and you can see the locations of Oxford Brookes University 
  and the Mathematics Department on the **Venues** section of our website.<br>
  <br>
  **What do I need to bring?**<br>
