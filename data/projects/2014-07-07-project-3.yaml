  <br>
  **How do I travel from Oxford Brookes University to the Oxford Mathematics Department?**<br>
  The events at Oxford Brookes University and the Mathematics Department will be on different days,
  so there should be no need to travel between these places on the same day.
  However, depending on where you are staying you may need to use the bus services
  that run in Oxford. 
  <a href="https://city.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables-fares/" target="_blank">OxfordBus</a> 
  has timetables of buses throughout Oxford and you can see the locations of Oxford Brookes University 
  and the Mathematics Department on the **Venues** section of our website.<br>
  <br>
  **What do I need to bring?**<br>
  We will not be providing water bottles or coffee cups, so we recommend that you bring
  these with you. Some notepads and pens will be available upon request, but they will
  not be distributed to each attendee<br>
  <br>
