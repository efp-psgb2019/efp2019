  **SPEED PRESENTATIONS**
  <br><br>
  Each speed presentation will be allocated a 5-minute slot, including 4 minutes of presentation and 1 minute for a question and transition to the next speaker. It should contain 12 slides (inclusive of title and acknowledgement slides), which we will automate for you at 20 seconds each. If you wish to use fewer than 12 slides or different timing per slide, please pre-automate your slide progression before sending it to us and we will add it to the slideshow queue. The entire presentation must be 12 slides or less and 4 minutes or less. For instructions on how to do this, see the "Set a time to advance to the next slide" section here. Presentations must be in .ppt or .pptx, in the Standard (4:3) format. Final presentations must be sent to info@efp-psgb2019.com by **Aug. 30, 2019**.
  <br><br>
  **POSTER PRESENTATIONS**
  <br><br>
  All posters must be in A0 Portrait format. Due to the space requirements we are not able to accommodate any other formats. Presenters are expected to print and bring their poster with them to the meeting and are responsible for hanging their own poster on the designated board on **Monday, Sep. 9**, and for removing them by the end of the day on **Tuesday, Sep. 10**. The poster session will be run from 5:30pm - 7pm on **Monday, Sept 9** with all presenting throughout. 
  <br><br>
  There are two nearby poster printing locations in Oxford: Brookes Print (for Oxford Brookes), and Oxford Print Centre (for the city centre/Maths Institute). If you choose to use these services, we recommend that you contact them in advance to ensure that your poster is printed and ready to be picked up on time for your presentation.
